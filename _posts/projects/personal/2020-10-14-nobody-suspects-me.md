## Design
This was the first game where I created my own art, and therefore spent less time
coding and more studying palettes, researching pixel art, and learning how to use some pretty cool tools.

The original idea for the game was to make it a rhythm-based game where you would have to not only find the exit to the maze, but keep a rhythm by pressing 1 of 4 buttons at the right time.
I spent quite a while on this, considering whether it would work or not. Due to the time constraints I had to scrap the whole idea and come up with something simpler.

Potions lie around the maze, which fill your disgues metter up, but also act as a breadcrumbs of sorts.
The player is expected to explore the map while leaving some potions behind in case they get lost.

## Challenges
Definitely wearing multiple hats designing, coding, debugging, doing art, marketing all within a limited timeframe (over 3 weekends).
