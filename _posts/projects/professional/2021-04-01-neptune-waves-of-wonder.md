### Overview
At my time with House of How, I contributed to a slot machine game developed for DraftKings called Neptune: Waves of Wonder.
The game was an underwater themed slot machine game with traditional slot mechanics including big symbols and scatter symbols, which could lead to free spins.

### Contributions
My role focused on front-end development, specifically responding to real-time game state changes provided through server responses. I also assisted in some vfx animations using Adobe Animate.
- Implement slot spin animations using tweening libraries, while optimizing performance across multiple devices.
- Implement vfx animations using Adobe Animate for big win events using assets provided by the art team.
- Implement game state changes based on server responses to update the UI and game logic.
